My first compelete project in Django framework.
I loved the experience, this was a project based on Django 5 by example book by Antonio Melé

Things i've learned here: 

- **Full-featured blog engine** with post creation, update, and delete.
- **Admin interface** for managing posts and comments.
- **Trigram similarity search** (PostgreSQL) for fuzzy, typo-tolerant post search.
- **SEO-friendly URLs** using slugs and canonical link structure.
- **Tagging system** with related post recommendations based on shared tags.
- **Comments system** with form validation and moderation in admin.
- **Post sharing via email** using Django’s email system and environment configs.
- **Pagination** for post list views.
- **Custom model managers and querysets** for clean, DRY data access.
- **Class-based and function-based views** for flexibility and reuse.
